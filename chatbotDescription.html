    <h2>ðŸ’¬ FAQ ChatBot â€“ Intelligent Question Answering System</h2>
    <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, Scikit-learn (TF-IDF), Cosine Similarity</p>

    <p>
      The FAQ ChatBot is a web-based question-answering system designed to mimic an interactive Frequently Asked Questions assistant.
      Built with <strong>Flask</strong> on the backend and <strong>HTML/CSS</strong> on the frontend, this project allows users to input questions in natural language and receive relevant answers from a curated FAQ dataset.
    </p>

    <p>
      At its core, the chatbot leverages <strong>TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)</strong> to transform text into numerical vectors,
      and uses <strong>cosine similarity</strong> to measure the similarity between the userâ€™s question and existing FAQs.
      The answer with the highest similarity score is returned, making it capable of understanding user intent even when the exact wording doesn't match.
    </p>

    <p>
      This approach enables the chatbot to deliver meaningful and contextually accurate answers, making it a lightweight yet powerful solution
      for organizations looking to automate customer support, onboarding FAQs, or internal knowledge bases.
